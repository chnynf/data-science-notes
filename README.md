This is going to be a place where I (slowly) update my data science notes to keep my memory refreshed. I plan to use Github Actions to automatically push this md file to my blog. Most of the snippets here will be the ones I pick up from the internet, from me and my friendâ€™s notes, and from the book All of Statistics: A Concise Course in Statistical Inference, from Larry A. Wasserman.
