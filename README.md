A place where I slowly update my data science notes to keep my memory refreshed. This repo will be automatically pushed to my blog chnynf.github.io using Github Actions. Most of the snippets here will be the ones I pick up from the internet, from me and my friendâ€™s notes, from the book All of Statistics: A Concise Course in Statistical Inference, from Larry A. Wasserman, and from my Gatech CS course notes.
